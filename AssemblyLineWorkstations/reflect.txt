This assignment was a combination of almost every material we learned in this course, such as static variables, external linkage, 
containers and iterators, error handling, lambda expressions, algorithms, and â€¦. 

One of the new things in this assignment is the deque container. We used vector and list several times in our workshop, 
but we never used deque. Deque is a kind of container which is very similar to a vector, but the only difference is that you can edit a deque from both front and back, 
unlike a vector that you can only edit from the back.

In general, this assignment was not very challenging, except for milestone 3. I had to go back and change the extractTocken function in the Utilities module to make milestone 3 work.

Other than the lineManager constructor, run function member, and attemptToMoveOrder from the Workstation module, there was no challenge in milestone 3.

In my opinion, the most important outcome of this assignment was to review all the course material, plus learn more about deque containers. 
Also, we had to use the algorithms instead of normal loops in some parts, which helped me master algorithms more than before.

It was a good thing to practice reading from a file and load the data inside our classes again.
